## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- **Project rename:** `dpx_buttons_relay_armbian` → **`dpx-buttnode`** — repo name, artifact names,
  release tags, workflow names, and all OUR identifiers updated. Bitfocus package names unchanged.
- **`dpx-node-ui` → `dpx-buttnode-ui`:** service, binary path, web page title, and avahi XML
  file renamed. mDNS service type `_dpx-buttnode._tcp` unchanged.
- **Companion Satellite A/B mode:** Companion Satellite (headless) is now installed alongside
  Buttons USB Relay. Both are installed at image build time; only one runs at a time.
  - Default mode on first flash: **Buttons USB Relay** (satellite installed but disabled)
  - `scripts/install-satellite.sh` — installs Companion Satellite using the official install
    script (`pi-image/install.sh`) inside the Packer chroot; leaves `satellite.service` disabled;
    adds `satellite` user to `buttons` group for HID device access (Stream Deck udev fix)
  - `dpx-buttnode.pkr.hcl` — two new provisioners: copy + run `install-satellite.sh`
  - Mode persistence: `/etc/dpx-mode` stores `buttons` or `satellite` across reboots
  - Mode switching via `systemctl enable/disable` on each service
- **Mode tab in `dpx-buttnode-ui`:** new "Mode" tab in the web UI for A/B switching
  - Large mode badge (BUTTONS / SATELLITE) with colour coding
  - Service status for the active service
  - Switch button: stops+disables current service, enables+starts the other
  - Companion server config form: Host + Port (default 16622), saved to
    `/etc/dpx-satellite.conf` and `/boot/satellite-config`; POSTs to satellite REST API
    (`http://localhost:9999/api/config`) if satellite is currently running
- **Mode status card on Status page:** Status tab now shows current mode (BUTTONS/SATELLITE),
  active service status, and (in satellite mode) the configured Companion host:port
- **HID device permission fix:** `satellite` user added to `buttons` group at build time so
  Stream Decks are accessible when in satellite mode (udev owns `/dev/hidraw*` as `root:buttons`)
- **Comprehensive README:** added Satellite mode usage section, Mode tab screenshots, terminal
  mode-switch commands, Companion configuration instructions

### Changed
- Artifact filename format: `{board}-dpx-buttnode-{version}-build{N}.img.gz`
  (was `{board}-buttons-usb-relay-{version}-build{N}.img.gz`)
- Release tag format: `dpx-buttnode-{version}-build{N}` (was `buttons-usb-relay-...`)

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- **Dynamic hostname:** `dpx-set-hostname.service` sets hostname to `dpx-buttnode-XXXX` (last 4 hex
  chars of primary Ethernet MAC, uppercase) on first boot. Reads MAC from `/sys/class/net/<iface>/type`
  (kernel sysfs, available before network stack starts). Ordered `Before=network.target avahi-daemon.service`
  so avahi reads the correct hostname on first start.
- **`dpx-buttnode-ui` web UI** on port 8080 — pure Python 3 stdlib, zero extra packages.
  Tabs: Status, Hostname, Network, Devices, Nodes.
  - **Hostname:** `hostnamectl` + `/etc/hosts` + avahi reload
  - **Network:** DHCP ↔ static. Works on Armbian with Netplan + systemd-networkd.
    Writes `/etc/systemd/network/09-dpx-<iface>.network` (sorts before Netplan's `10-` wildcard),
    deletes the conflicting `/run/systemd/network/10-netplan-all-eth-interfaces.network`,
    then restarts networkd — the only approach that reliably beats Netplan's DHCP wildcard.
  - **Devices:** USB device list, Stream Deck USB power cycle (unbind/rebind port), Buttons service restart
  - **Nodes:** `avahi-browse _dpx-buttnode._tcp` discovers all other buttnodes on the LAN with links to their UIs
- `avahi-daemon.service` drop-in: `After=network-online.target` so mDNS announces on the correct IP after boot
- `_dpx-buttnode._tcp` mDNS service registration so all units appear in the Nodes tab

### Fixed
- Previous dynamic hostname (`41f433a`) used `After=network-pre.target` + fragile awk — replaced
- `netplan apply` silently returns rc=1 and deletes override files on this Armbian build — bypassed
  entirely by writing directly to `/etc/systemd/network/` and restarting networkd
- Armbian Netplan wildcard `e*` DHCP config alphabetically beats explicit `end0` static config —
  fixed by using `09-` prefix (sorts before Netplan's `10-`) and removing the `/run/` wildcard

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Dynamic hostname at first boot: `dpx-buttnode-XXXX` derived from last 4 hex chars of MAC address
- `dpx-set-hostname.service` systemd oneshot service handles hostname assignment
- Secure root password baked in via `ROOT_PASSWORD` GitHub Secret (never in code)
- `ROOT_PASSWORD` secret properly chained through `workflow_call` to Packer build
- `custom-board` free-text input on `armbian-builder.yaml` — build any board not in dropdown
- `publish-release.yaml` workflow — re-publish a release from existing build artifacts without recompiling
- Release tags now include pipeline version: `dpx-buttnode-X.Y.Z-buildA.B.C`
- `force=true` on release workflow deletes and recreates the same tag; normal runs never overwrite
- Orange Pi Zero 3 added to release matrix
- Full 150+ Armbian board list in manual dispatch dropdown

### Fixed
- Removed all IPv6 disable config (`armbianEnv.txt`, sysctl, NetworkManager) — was breaking DHCP
- Self-referencing board resolve step removed; board now resolved inline in each step
- `PACKER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` passed to `packer init` to avoid GitHub API rate limit
- `sudo` removed from `compile.sh` call (Armbian rejects being run as root)
- All post-Packer file ops use `sudo`; final `.gz` gets `chown runner:runner` for artifact upload
- YAML heredoc inside `run:` block extracted to `scripts/generate-release-notes.sh`
- Release options array syntax fixed for GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- SSH enabled by default in image (`root` / `1234`) — no serial cable needed for debugging
- IPv6 disabled system-wide via sysctl; NetworkManager forced to IPv4 DHCP only
- `scripts/generate-release-notes.sh` — extracted from workflow to fix YAML heredoc parse error
- `scripts/upload-mirror.sh` — one-command helper to push new Bitfocus packages to mirror release
- Full 150+ Armbian board list in `workflow_dispatch` dropdown
- Rock Pi S (`rockpi-s`) corrected from wrong ID `rockpis`

### Fixed
- YAML syntax errors in `release-action.yaml` (inline array options, heredoc inside block scalar)
- `sudo mv` / `sudo gzip` / `sudo chown` for root-owned Armbian and Packer build outputs
- Release job now deletes existing tag before recreating (handles force rebuilds cleanly)
- Auto-release matrix switched from Orange Pi Zero to Rock Pi (`rockpi-s`, `rockpi-4b`, `rockpi-4bplus`, `rock-s0`)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Automated two-stage build pipeline: Armbian base image + HashiCorp Packer chroot customization
- Self-hosted package mirror via GitHub Releases (`buttons-deb-mirror` tag) — no Bitfocus credentials needed in CI
- Matrix builds for Orange Pi Zero family (`orangepizero`, `orangepizero2`, `orangepizero2w`, `orangepizero3`)
- Daily scheduled version check — auto-builds and publishes a GitHub Release when mirror is updated
- `scripts/upload-mirror.sh` — one-command helper to upload new Bitfocus packages to the mirror release
- `scripts/download-buttons.sh` — downloads package from mirror release using built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `scripts/install-buttons.sh` — installs `.deb` inside Armbian chroot, enables `avahi-daemon` for mDNS discovery
- `dpx-buttnode.pkr.hcl` — Packer build definition targeting ARM64 Armbian images
- Initial support for Bitfocus Buttons USB Relay Headless v0.1.0-beta.4
