## PROJECT: dpx-buttnode

**Status:** v0.5.0 complete (2026-07-24) ✅  
**Branch:** `main` (feature/dpx-buttnode-rename-satellite pending PR)  
**Version File:** `VERSION` (currently 0.5.0)

### Architecture (2-minute summary)

Automated GitHub Actions build pipeline that produces flash-ready `.img.gz` Armbian images for ARM single-board computers with **both Bitfocus Buttons USB Relay and Companion Satellite** pre-installed. Default mode is Buttons; switch to Satellite via the web UI or SSH — no re-flash needed. Two-stage build: (1) Armbian build framework compiles a minimal Ubuntu Noble base image for the target board, (2) HashiCorp Packer chroots into the image — installs the Buttons `.deb`, then builds Companion Satellite from source via the official `pi-image/install.sh` script (Node.js + Yarn, ~30–60 min extra). The Buttons package is distributed as a `.tar.gz` from Bitfocus's auth-gated portal — this project solves that by maintaining a self-hosted mirror release (`buttons-deb-mirror`) in the repo, so CI only needs the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. No Bitfocus credentials ever touch CI.

| Component | Tech/Location | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Packer build definition | HCL / `dpx-buttnode.pkr.hcl` | Chroot customization of Armbian image | Uses `arm-image` plugin v0.2.7; targets 5 GB image; runs both install scripts |
| Buttons install script | Bash / `scripts/install-buttons.sh` | Installs Buttons `.deb`, installs dpx-buttnode-ui + dpx-set-hostname, enables all services, registers mDNS | Runs as root inside Packer shell provisioner |
| Satellite install script | Bash / `scripts/install-satellite.sh` | Installs Companion Satellite from source, disables it (buttons is default), adds `satellite` user to `buttons` group | Runs after `install-buttons.sh`; needs network inside chroot; ~30-60 min |
| Hostname script | Bash / `scripts/dpx-set-hostname.sh` | Sets `dpx-buttnode-XXXX` hostname from MAC on first boot | Reads MAC from sysfs; oneshot service runs Before=network.target avahi-daemon.service |
| Web UI | Python / `src/dpx-buttnode-ui/dpx-buttnode-ui.py` | Device config UI on port 8080: hostname, DHCP/static network, USB devices, node discovery, **mode switch** | Pure Python 3 stdlib; tabs: Status, Hostname, Network, Devices, Nodes, Mode |
| UI preview pages | HTML / `html/dpx-buttnode-ui-*.html` | Static mock previews of each UI tab for screenshots and dev reference | Moved to `html/` subfolder; file map in `.github/skills/screenshot-html-preview/SKILL.md` |
| Mode file | `/etc/dpx-mode` | Persists current mode (`buttons` or `satellite`) across reboots | Read by UI and by switch logic; written on mode change |
| Satellite config | `/etc/dpx-satellite.conf` | Persists Companion server HOST/PORT | Written by UI POST /satellite-config; also stages `/boot/satellite-config` |
| Download script | Bash / `scripts/download-buttons.sh` | Pulls `.tar.gz` from mirror release, extracts `.deb` | Primary: `gh release download`; fallback: `gh api /releases` list + `curl` |
| Mirror upload helper | Bash / `scripts/upload-mirror.sh` | LOCAL script — uploads new Bitfocus package to mirror release | Run by maintainer when new Buttons version drops; requires `gh` auth |
| Build workflow | YAML / `.github/workflows/armbian-builder.yaml` | Reusable: builds Armbian + downloads package + runs Packer + uploads artifact | Called by `release-action.yaml` or triggered manually |
| Release workflow | YAML / `.github/workflows/release-action.yaml` | Daily cron version check + matrix build + GitHub Release publish | Compares mirror asset filename against latest release tag to detect new versions |
| Package mirror | GitHub Release / tag `buttons-deb-mirror` | Hosts the Bitfocus `.tar.gz` for CI to download | **Maintainer updates this when Bitfocus ships a new version** |

### Agent Rules (for this repo)

**Before ANY code change:**
1. Create feature branch from `main`: `feature/brief-description`
2. Bump `VERSION` file per semantic versioning (AGENTS.md §1)
3. Commit version bump standalone: `git commit -m "bump version to X.Y.Z"` + `git tag vX.Y.Z`

**While coding:**
- Never commit `.tar.gz`, `.deb`, `.img`, or `.img.gz` files — they are gitignored; use the mirror release
- Workflow YAML changes must be tested by manually triggering `armbian-builder.yaml` on one board before touching the matrix
- The `deb_path` variable in `dpx-buttnode.pkr.hcl` must always point to `artifacts/bitfocus-buttons-usb-relay-headless.deb` — that's the normalized name `download-buttons.sh` outputs
- Keep the `buttons-deb-mirror` release tag permanent — never delete it; it is the CI package source
- File header per AGENTS.md §3

**When done:**
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version entry and date
- Update `VERSION` file
- Create PR per AGENTS.md §1 template
- Verify `armbian-builder.yaml` can still run `workflow_dispatch` manually without errors

### Critical Constraints

**MUST HAVE:**
- ✅ `buttons-deb-mirror` GitHub Release must always exist with a valid `.tar.gz` asset — CI fails without it
- ✅ `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions `contents: read` on builder, `contents: write` on release job
- ✅ `qemu-user-static` installed on the runner before Packer runs (ARM64 chroot requirement)
- ✅ `avahi-daemon` installed inside the image (mDNS discovery on port 3040)
- ✅ `VERSION` file kept in sync with `CHANGELOG.md`

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Add `BITFOCUS_EMAIL` / `BITFOCUS_PASSWORD` secrets — the mirror approach eliminates this entirely
- ❌ Commit binary files (`.deb`, `.tar.gz`, images) to git — use the mirror release
- ❌ Delete or rename the `buttons-deb-mirror` release tag — it breaks all CI builds
- ❌ Change the Packer output path `output-dpx-buttnode/` without updating the compression step in `armbian-builder.yaml`
- ❌ Modify the board matrix in `release-action.yaml` without confirming the board is in the Armbian supported list

### Key Decisions

- **Self-hosted mirror over portal auth:** Bitfocus Buttons USB Relay is closed-source with an auth-gated download portal and no public API docs. Rather than reverse-engineering the login flow and storing credentials as secrets, the maintainer manually uploads `.tar.gz` packages to a dedicated GitHub Release. CI downloads using the always-available `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Simple, reliable, zero secrets.
- **Packer over Armbian userpatches:** Image customization happens post-build via Packer chroot, not via Armbian's native overlay system. This decouples the Armbian build from the Buttons install — the Armbian image can be rebuilt independently, and Packer applies the same customization regardless of Armbian version changes.
- **Version detected from asset filename:** The release workflow determines the Buttons version by parsing the `.tar.gz` filename in the mirror release (e.g., `bitfocus-buttons-usb-relay-headless_0.1.0-beta.4_arm64.tar.gz` → `0.1.0-beta.4`). No API call required. Filename is the source of truth.
- **Orange Pi Zero family as default matrix:** Same boards as the reference project (`companion-satellite-armbian`). They're cheap, low-power, well-supported by Armbian, and ideal for a dedicated USB relay appliance.
- **SSH enabled by default:** Enabled so hardware testing and debugging don't require a serial adapter. Credentials: `root` / `1234` (Armbian forces password change on first login).

### Gotchas & Landmines

1. **Armbian build framework is large and slow:** The `git clone --depth=1` of `armbian/build` takes several minutes. The full compile step is 30-60+ minutes per board. Companion Satellite adds another 30-60 min (Node.js + Yarn build inside chroot). Don't expect fast CI feedback loops.
2. **`buttons-deb-mirror` must exist before first CI run:** Run `./scripts/upload-mirror.sh <tarball>` locally before triggering any workflow. The download step will fail with a 404 if the mirror release doesn't exist.
3. **Debian version notation uses `~` for pre-release:** The `.deb` inside the tarball uses `0.1.0~beta.4` (tilde) but the tarball filename uses `0.1.0-beta.4` (dash). `download-buttons.sh` handles this — don't try to parse the `.deb` filename directly.
4. **DO NOT disable IPv6:** Tried `ipv6.disable=1` in `armbianEnv.txt` and `NetworkManager ipv6.method=disabled` — both broke DHCP, the board got no IP at all. Armbian's network stack relies on IPv6 being present during interface bring-up. Leave networking alone.
5. **Packer `arm-image` plugin requires `sudo`:** All `packer init` and `packer build` calls must be prefixed with `sudo`. The plugin modifies loop devices and mounts.
6. **Netplan/networkd conflict on Armbian (Ubuntu Noble):** Armbian uses Netplan with `10-dhcp-all-interfaces.yaml` containing a wildcard `match: name: "e*"` DHCP config. `netplan apply` returns rc=1 when given a conflicting override file and deletes it. The working solution: write `/etc/systemd/network/09-dpx-<iface>.network` (the `09-` prefix sorts before Netplan's `10-`) AND delete `/run/systemd/network/10-netplan-all-eth-interfaces.network` before restarting networkd.
7. **`netplan version` is not a valid subcommand** on this Armbian build — use `Path("/usr/sbin/netplan").exists()` to detect Netplan instead.
8. **Satellite service name is `satellite`** (not `companion-satellite`). The official `pi-image/install.sh` creates a systemd unit named `satellite`. Never assume otherwise.
9. **`/boot/satellite-config` is a one-shot import.** Satellite reads it on startup and resets the file to prevent re-import on next boot. Our persistent store is `/etc/dpx-satellite.conf`. The UI writes both on every save.
10. **HID device permissions — `satellite` user must be in `buttons` group.** The Buttons USB Relay udev rules own `/dev/hidraw*` as `root:buttons`. The `satellite` service user needs `usermod -aG buttons satellite` to open Stream Decks. This is done in `install-satellite.sh`. If a device was installed before this fix, run it manually once.
11. **Satellite udev rules:** Installed at `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-satellite.rules` by the official install script. They set `GROUP="satellite"` for known vendor IDs — but the Buttons rule (installed earlier) wins for Stream Decks. The group fix (gotcha #10) is the correct solution; do not delete or reorder udev rules.
12. **Satellite REST API on port 9999:** `http://localhost:9999/api/config` — GET returns current config; POST `{"host":"...","port":16622}` updates it live. Used by the web UI's `/satellite-config` POST handler.

### Common Operations

**Update Buttons to a new version:**
```bash
./scripts/upload-mirror.sh ~/Downloads/bitfocus-buttons-usb-relay-headless_X.Y.Z_arm64.tar.gz
gh workflow run release-action.yaml --repo dubpixel/dpx_buttnode
```

**Manual single-board test build:**
Go to Actions → Build Armbian + dpx-buttnode Image → Run workflow → pick board

**Force re-release of current version:**
Actions → Release — dpx-buttnode Images → Run workflow → Force: true

**Add a new board to the matrix:**
Edit `.github/workflows/release-action.yaml` under `matrix.board`, add the Armbian board ID. Also add it to the `workflow_dispatch` options in `armbian-builder.yaml`.

> Manual-only boards (not in auto-release matrix): everything else in the 150+ board `workflow_dispatch` list

> Auto-release matrix boards: `rockpi-s`, `rockpi-4b`, `rockpi-4bplus`, `rock-s0`

**Check what version is in the mirror:**
```bash
gh release view buttons-deb-mirror --repo dubpixel/dpx_buttnode --json assets --jq '.assets[].name'
```

### Reference

**Source of truth for Buttons USB Relay installation and configuration:**
https://support.bitfocus.io/hc/en-us/articles/33855997471890-Bitfocus-Buttons-USB-Relay-Raspberry-Pi

If anything about the install process, service name, config file location, or port changes — check here first before assuming the code is wrong.

This is broadcast infrastructure tooling — it runs 24/7 as a headless appliance in a production AV environment. Reliability and simplicity trump features. The image must boot clean, start the service automatically, and be discoverable via mDNS with zero configuration. Keep the build pipeline transparent and auditable: no magic, no hidden credentials, no framework abstractions that obscure what's actually happening inside the image.

## 1. Automatic Workflow (MANDATORY)

These actions are **required** and must happen automatically. **NEVER ask permission** for these workflow steps.

### Branching Strategy

**BEFORE starting ANY code changes:**

1. Create a new branch from the default branch (master/main)
2. Never work directly on default branch
3. Branch naming conventions:

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| New feature | `feature/brief-description` | `feature/mqtt-decoder` |
| Bug fix | `fix/issue-description` | `fix/telegraf-timeout` |
| Documentation | `docs/what-changed` | `docs/update-architecture` |
| Refactor | `refactor/component-name` | `refactor/docker-volumes` |

### Version Bumping

**BEFORE the first code change:**

Bump the version number according to semantic versioning:

| Change Type | Version Bump | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Bug fix, typo fix, documentation update | Patch (0.0.X) | 1.2.3 → 1.2.4 |
| New feature, new endpoint, new capability | Minor (0.X.0) | 1.2.3 → 1.3.0 |
| Breaking change, API removal, incompatible change | Major (X.0.0) | 1.2.3 → 2.0.0 |

#### Semantic Versioning Principles

**Format:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `2.4.7`)

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes, breaking existing functionality
- **MINOR**: New functionality added in a backwards-compatible manner  
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes, docs, typos

**Pre-1.0 versions (0.x.y):**
- Anything goes - breaking changes allowed in minor bumps
- Common for projects in initial development
- Move to 1.0.0 when API is stable and production-ready

**Pre-release versions:**
- Alpha: `1.0.0-alpha.1` (early testing, unstable)
- Beta: `1.0.0-beta.2` (feature-complete, testing for bugs)
- Release Candidate: `1.0.0-rc.1` (final testing before release)

#### Version Bumping Decision Tree

**When multiple changes occur, use the highest level:**
- Bug fix + new feature → Minor bump (not patch)
- New feature + breaking change → Major bump (not minor)

**Edge cases:**

| Scenario | Bump Type | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Internal refactor, no API change | Patch | No external impact |
| New optional parameter with default | Minor | Backwards-compatible addition |
| Changed parameter order | Major | Breaks existing calls |
| Deprecated feature (still works) | Minor | Deprecation warning added |
| Removed deprecated feature | Major | Functionality removed |
| Performance improvement | Patch | Implementation detail |
| New dependency added | Minor | Expands capabilities |
| Security fix | Patch | Even if behavior changes slightly |
| Database schema change | Major | Requires migration |
| Config file format change | Major | Breaking existing configs |

#### Version Bump Workflow

1. **Determine bump type** based on changes planned
2. **Update version number** in code/config files
3. **Create git commit**: `bump version to X.Y.Z`
4. **Tag the commit**: `git tag vX.Y.Z` (note the `v` prefix)
5. **Push with tags**: `git push && git push --tags`
6. **Update CHANGELOG** (if present) with version and changes
7. **Proceed with feature/fix implementation**

**Version commit should be standalone** - don't mix version bump with other changes.

#### Changelog Integration

If project has CHANGELOG.md, update it with version bump:

```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- New feature description

### Fixed
- Bug fix description

### Changed
- Breaking change description
```
**If no CHANGELOG.MD file exists:** Create one in the root of the project.

**Where to bump version:**
- Python: `__version__` in `__init__.py` or `pyproject.toml`
- Node.js: `version` field in `package.json`
- General: `VERSION` file or constant in main entry point
- Docker: Version tag in `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile` labels

**If no version file exists:** Create one in an appropriate location for the project.

### Version File Standards & Location

To ensure consistent version identification across projects, follow these standards:

#### Python Projects

**Preferred location: `app/__init__.py` or `src/__init__.py`**

```python
"""Project description."""

__version__ = "1.0.0"
__author__ = "dubpixel"
```

**Alternative: `pyproject.toml` (for modern Python packaging)**

```toml
[project]
name = "project-name"
version = "1.0.0"
```

**Alternative: `VERSION` file in project root**

```
1.0.0
```

Then read it in your module:
```python
from pathlib import Path
__version__ = (Path(__file__).parent / "VERSION").read_text().strip()
```

#### Node.js/JavaScript Projects

**Location: `package.json`** (standard)

```json
{
  "name": "project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Project description"
}
```

#### Docker Projects

**Location: `docker-compose.yml` labels AND `Dockerfile`**

`docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    labels:
      - "org.opencontainers.image.version=1.0.0"
      - "org.opencontainers.image.created=${BUILD_DATE}"
```

`Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.version="1.0.0"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="Project Name"
```

#### Bash Scripts/Utilities

**Location: Top of main script or separate `VERSION` file**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
VERSION="1.0.0"
SCRIPT_NAME="manage.sh"

# Or read from VERSION file:
# VERSION=$(cat VERSION)
```

#### Version Display (REQUIRED)

**Always provide a way to display the version:**

- Python CLI: `python -m myapp --version`
- Node.js: `npm run version` or built into CLI
- Docker: `docker inspect <image> | grep version`
- Bash: `./script.sh --version`

**Example implementations:**

```python
# In your main.py or CLI entry point
import argparse
from app import __version__

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--version', action='version', version=f'%(prog)s {__version__}')
```

```bash
# In bash script
if [[ "$1" == "--version" ]] || [[ "$1" == "-v" ]]; then
    echo "$SCRIPT_NAME version $VERSION"
    exit 0
fi
```

#### Multi-Component Projects

For projects with multiple components (e.g., frontend + backend + Docker):

1. **Synchronized versioning**: All components share the same version
2. **Central `VERSION` file** in project root
3. **Scripts/tools read from central file**

Example structure:
```
project-root/
├── VERSION              # 1.0.0
├── backend/
│   └── __init__.py      # Reads ../VERSION
├── frontend/
│   └── package.json     # Reads ../VERSION via build script
└── docker-compose.yml   # Reads VERSION via envsubst or build args
```

### Pull Request Creation

**AFTER completing the task:**

Create a pull request with this format:

```markdown
## Changes
- [Brief list of what changed]
- [One item per significant change]

## Testing
- [How to verify the changes work]
- [Commands to run or steps to follow]

## User Prompt
[The original request from the user - verbatim]
```

**PR Title Format:** `[Component] Brief description`

Examples:
- `[MQTT] Add BLE decoder support`
- `[Docs] Consolidate architecture documentation`
- `[Telegraf] Fix enum processor deprecation`

**NEVER ask permission to create the PR - just do it.**

---

## 2. Progress Tracking for Multi-Step Work

When working on tasks that span **more than 3 files** OR **more than 30 minutes of work**:

### Checkpoint Progress

Provide a status update using this template:

```markdown
## Progress Checkpoint

✅ **Completed:**
- Item 1 description
- Item 2 description

⬜ **Remaining:**
- Item 3 description
- Item 4 description

→ **Next Action:** [Specific next step you will take]
```

### When to Checkpoint

- After completing a logical phase of work
- Before switching to a different component
- When encountering a blocker or decision point
- Every 3-5 file edits in large refactors

### Resuming from Checkpoint

When continuing work after a checkpoint:
1. Read the last checkpoint status
2. Start with the "Next Action" item
3. Update checkpoint when that phase completes

**Purpose:** Prevents agents from getting lost in complex multi-step tasks and provides visibility to the user.

---

## 3. File Header Standards

All code files must include a comprehensive header comment section:

```
# ================================================================================
# [FILE TYPE] - [FILE PURPOSE]
# ================================================================================
# you can maybe write some stuff here - tagline etc.
# ================================================================================
# PROJECT: [project_name]
# ================================================================================
#
# File: [filename]
# Purpose: [what this file does]
# Dependencies: [key dependencies if any]
#
# CHANGE LOG: (if needed but should really be in the changelog for the git)
# 
# 2026-03-06: Complete rewrite - Interactive wizard (v2.1.0)
#
# ================================================================================
```

### Header Guidelines

- Use consistent separator lines (80 characters of `=`)
- Adjust comment syntax for the language (`#` for Python/bash, `//` for JS/C++, etc.)


---

## 4. Documentation Standards

### Project Context Documentation

Project-specific architecture, decisions, and operational knowledge should live in the **PROJECT section at the top of this file**. This keeps rules and context unified in one scannable document.

**When to use a separate CONTEXT.md:**
Only create a separate `CONTEXT.md` if reference data becomes large enough to be noisy:
- Long IP/VLAN tables
- Full API response examples  
- Hardware pinout references
- Extensive data schemas

If you create CONTEXT.md for overflow, add a reference in the PROJECT section at the top: "See CONTEXT.md for full network topology."

### How to Document Project Context

**DO:**
- ✅ Keep it clean, factual, and scannable
- ✅ Update when architecture changes
- ✅ Add information when you learn important project details
- ✅ Use tables, code blocks, and clear headings
- ✅ Think: "What does the next agent need to know?"
- ✅ Write in present tense, authoritative voice

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Append conversation transcripts
- ❌ Include timestamps like "On Feb 12 we discussed..."
- ❌ Make it a session log or diary
- ❌ Duplicate content from README.md (link instead)
- ❌ Let it become verbose or messy

**Update frequency:** Whenever you make architectural changes or learn critical project information.

---

## 5. Core Principles


### No Modifications to Working Code

- Do not refactor, optimize, or "improve" code that is working unless explicitly requested
- Avoid drive-by refactors when implementing a feature
- If you see potential improvements, mention them but don't implement without approval

### Comprehensive Commenting

- Document all code with clear, meaningful comments
- Preserve existing comments unless they become obsolete
- Remove or update comments that are no longer accurate
- Document WHY, not just WHAT (the code shows what, comments explain why)

### Small, Incremental Changes

- Make one logical change per commit
- Break large tasks into smaller steps
- Test each change before moving to the next
- Make it easy to review and roll back if needed

### Stay Focused

- Complete the current task before suggesting next steps
- Answer only what is asked
- Don't anticipate or propose additional work unless requested

### Document Everything

- README.md must be updated and maintaned when appropriate as per these guidelines
- CONTEXT.md must be updated and maintaned when appropriate as per these guidelines
- a comprehensive CHANGELOG.md must be kept updated and maintaned when appropriate as per these guidelines
- you can maintain a small changelog in the header if you wish but main changelog should be in the MD

---

## 6. Documentation Standards

### Inline Documentation

- Maintain comprehensive inline documentation
- Update comments when code changes (keep them in sync)
- Document all function parameters and return values
- Include usage examples for complex functions
- Explain algorithms and business logic


### README Files

- Keep README.md current and accurate
- README is user-facing - focus on how to USE the project
- **Confirm all changes to README with the user before committing**
- README should not duplicate CONTEXT.md (different audiences)

### CHANGELOG.MD

- Keep CHANGELOG.md current and accurate
- CHANGELOG is user-facing - focus on changes, version numbers, dates and git hashes if needed
- **keep this automated in background**
- changelog could be retroactively updated to reflect git commit names if that adds clariy
- **any changes to existing changelog line items should be confirmed with user**

### Markdown Style

- Use consistent heading hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Use tables for structured information
- Include code blocks with language tags
- Use relative links to other project files
- Keep line length reasonable (~80-100 chars for prose)

---

## 7. Code Quality Guidelines

### General Principles

- Write clear, readable code with meaningful names
- Follow established coding patterns within the project
- Implement proper error handling (don't use bare `except:` or `catch`)
- Write testable code with clear interfaces
- Maintain consistent formatting and style

### Language-Specific

Agents should infer and follow the conventions of the language they're working in:
- Python: Follow PEP 8
- JavaScript: Follow project's ESLint config if present
- Bash: Follow Google Shell Style Guide principles
- Other languages: Use community-standard style guides

### Testing

- Add tests alongside new logic when appropriate
- Use deterministic inputs for tests (inject time/randomness, don't read system state)
- Name tests by behavior (e.g., `test_early_finish_extends_break`)
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- if the process includes: using ssh into a remote server, or user input in any way. open a terminal first for the user so you both can read it. 

---

## 8. Change Management

### Commit Practices

- **Commit message format:** Short, plain English, lowercase verb
  - Examples: `add mqtt decoder`, `fix telegraf config`, `update documentation`
- Make one logical change per commit
- Commit functional units (don't commit broken code)

### Before Committing

- Verify the code works (run/test it)
- Update all relevant documentation
- Update file change logs
- Remove debug code and console.log/print statements
- Check that no credentials or secrets are included

### After Committing

- Push to the feature branch
- Create PR (as described in Section 1)
- Include verification steps in PR description

---

## 9. Collaboration Standards

### Respect Existing Architecture

- Understand existing architectural decisions before changing them
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Suggest alternatives when appropriate, but don't insist
- Consider the impact of changes on the broader codebase

### Maintain Backwards Compatibility

- Don't break existing APIs unless explicitly requested
- Provide migration paths for breaking changes
- Document any compatibility changes in PR description

### Communication

- Explain the reasoning behind suggested changes
- Provide rollback information when making significant changes
- Be transparent about limitations or uncertainties
- Keep responses concise and focused

---

## 10. Configuration & Secrets

### Environment Variables

- Use `.env` files for local development
- Provide `.env.example` with all required variables (use placeholder values)
- **NEVER commit** `.env` files or actual credentials to git
- Document all environment variables in CONTEXT.md or README.md

### Sensitive Data

- Keep credentials in environment variables, not hardcoded
- Use service account files in standard locations (e.g., `~/.config/gcloud/`)
- Add sensitive files to `.gitignore` immediately
- If secrets are accidentally committed, notify the user immediately
